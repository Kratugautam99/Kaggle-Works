# 🏆 Kaggle-Works

> A personal hub to organize every phase of your Kaggle journeys—from raw data to polished submissions.

---

## 📖 Overview

Kaggle-Works enforces a clean, reproducible workflow for tabular-data competitions:

- **Competition-Submits/**  
  Store your CSV/JSON submissions and keep a history of top leaderboard runs.  
- **Zipped-Data/**  
  Untouched archive downloads (ZIP, TAR, etc.)—your “source-of-truth.”  
- **Extracted-Data/**  
  Unpacked & lightly cleaned CSV/Parquet files ready for analysis.  
- **My_Works/**  
  Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, utility modules, write-ups, and visualizations.

Whether you’re chasing that gold medal or simply honing your data chops, this repo structure helps you stay organized and shareable.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kratugautam99/Kaggle-Works.git
   cd Kaggle-Works
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**  
   Create a virtual environment and install your favorite libs:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Add raw data archives**  
   Drop your `.zip`/`.tar` files into `Zipped-Data/`.  
4. **Unpack & clean**  
   Extract into `Extracted-Data/` and run your preprocessing pipelines (in `My_Works/`).  
5. **Train & submit**  
   Develop models in `My_Works/`, save final `submission.csv` under `Competition-Submits/`.

## 💡 Usage Tips

-  Keep **raw data** immutable in `Zipped-Data/`.  
-  Version your **cleaned exports** in `Extracted-Data/`.  
-  Isolate EDA & experiments in `My_Works/`.  
-  **Never** overwrite prior submissions—store each attempt in `Competition-Submits/`.
